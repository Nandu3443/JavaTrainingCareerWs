**Instructions**: 
- Choose any exercise and answer all the questions for that scenario
- Focus on realistic, practical attributes and behaviors
- Think about what data each object would actually need to store
- Consider what actions each object would actually perform
- Don't worry about implementation details - just identify the HAS and DOES
